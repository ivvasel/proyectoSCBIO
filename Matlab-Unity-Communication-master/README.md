This are simple script to make Matlab communicate with unity

You can find the video tutorial at this link

IMPORTANT 1: in the public class ***** : MonoBehaviour

Instead of the ***** write the name of the c sharp file. Check the name associated to the object you cerated in unity and wirte that. In my case it was Cylinder.

IMPORTANT 2: when you created the c sharp file in unity, you first press play in unity and then run the matlab code,
otherwise it will not work.

If you are interested only in the c sharp code that makes matlab and unity communicate, you can find it in the "C_Sharp_Communication_Only" file.
